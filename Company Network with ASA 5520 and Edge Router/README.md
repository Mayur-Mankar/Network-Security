#Overview
In this project I have designed a Network using ASA firewall 5520, Cisco 2800 Router and a Cisco catalyst Switches.
The firewall has been configured with different security levels repect to the INSIDE, OUTSIDE and DMZ zone.
The management network is connected to a seperate switch on firewall from which management PC\s can remotely access
the network devices. If the OUTSIDE host wants to connect to an INSIDE network, after Authentication and Authorization
user can download and install AnyConnect VPN and connect to the INSIDE network.
